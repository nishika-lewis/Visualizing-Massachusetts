## 🎓 About the Course – CS617: Visualizing Boston @ UMass Boston

This project portfolio was developed for **CS617: Data Visualization and Storytelling for the Community** (Spring 2024), taught by **Professor Daniel Haehn** at UMass Boston.

The course focused on combining design, open data, and storytelling to create compelling narratives for community impact. Students explored a wide array of tools, design practices, and interactive frameworks, with a strong emphasis on ethical, inclusive, and accessible data visualizations.

We leveraged real data from the City of Boston and Massachusetts towns to explore visualization as a tool for journalism, policy, and public engagement.
